  Welcome to my art page! I am an independant artist with multiple years experience in different types of art work and styles. 
  My main strenghts are in pencil shaded artwork, coloured pemcil, water colour, acrylic paints and my personal favourite is 
  using ink to make a graffiti/comic style pieces of art. </p> 
  <p> I have been progressing in my work for the past 5 years and only recently 
  decided to sell my art work. Each price is thoroughly thought through taking into account the price of materials and the amount of 
  time it takes to complete each art piece to a high standard. Each piece has multiple steps to build it up from a basic sketch, into a finished
  art piece. </p>
  <p> I not only sell independant art pieces on my website, I also take requests for personalised art pieces. I work with a4, a3, a4 canvas, a3 canvas,
  other sizes can be considered as well. My most bold strengths reside in art work based on animals, wildlife, landscape and nature. I am always happy to discuss 
  other fields of art work as well. Feel free to take a look around the website and of you have any requests please head to the "Contact Us" page. </p>
